It is also one of the largest geographically spread cities and is known to have an unsual urban planning structure and not clear definitions of neighborhoods. With the city spreading and sprawling increasingly fast, how can a person moving to LA, like an aspiring actor or business person, figure out where to live in this complicated city? What if they want to live in a area with the most movie theaters, or restaurants, how can they choose which neighborhood to go to? To answer this question, I will be segmenting, clustering, and analyzing the neighborhoods of LA and figure out which neighborhoods are present, what they are known for, and what venue locations they have the most of.\n\n### This program can also work for tourists who are looking for a place to stay while visiting LA"

I will cluster and add the top venues categories for each neighborhood. Finally, I will sort the data to see which neighborhood or cluster will be the best for a certain venue category - so let's say that a person moving to LA really wants to live near movie theaters, they can see which neighborhoods will be the best for that.
